# BUAA1406OO
OrientObjective assignments of BUAA SCSE \n
The OO7th hasn't been debugged completely,because I finished OO7th on ubuntu,but now I am committing my code on windows10.\n
Please don't copy my code as your OO assignment,unless you will be failed in OO by WuJi for cheating.The code-checking system is very strict.
